    # NOTE: It is *strongly* recommended to use the rzcobs encoding when
    # using this crate. If the buffer is ever filled, then the remaining
    # bytes will be discarded, which will corrupt the message stream.
    #
    # Because rzcobs is delimited by zero bytes, it is possible to recover
    # from this corruption, with the loss of a limited number of messages.
    # When using the "raw" encoding, you MUST ensure that the buffer is
    # never overfilled, as it will NOT be possible to recover from this
    # error condition.
